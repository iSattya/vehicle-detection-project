🚘 Vehicle Detection & Speed Estimation System
An intelligent, AI-powered system that detects vehicles in real time, tracks their movement, and estimates their speed with precision. Designed for modern traffic surveillance, highway monitoring, and smart city solutions, this project merges computer vision and deep learning to offer a reliable way to monitor vehicular motion and ensure road safety.

🌟 Highlights
🔍 Real-Time Detection – Detect cars, trucks, and bikes with high accuracy using YOLO or any preferred object detection model.

🎯 Speed Estimation – Calculate the speed of each vehicle using frame-based tracking and calibrated distance.

🧠 Multi-Object Tracking – Assign unique IDs and track multiple vehicles simultaneously using algorithms like DeepSORT.

🖥️ Live or Recorded Input – Works with live webcam feeds or pre-recorded video files.

🚨 Overspeed Alerts – Set speed limits and log violations for traffic analytics and safety enforcement.

🖼️ Annotated Outputs – Get visually enriched videos with bounding boxes, IDs, and speed overlays.
